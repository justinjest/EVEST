# EVEST: EVE Station Trader

## So you wanna be space rich...

EVE Online is known for it's hard-working ~~victims~~ players. Folks that will gladly spend hundreds of hours hacking away on a spreadsheet that will make them .01 ISK more than the next capsuleer frantically refreshing buy orders.

It's no secret that mastering the market is the way to true pixel wealth in New Eden, but it's not easy.

Or at least it wasn't.

**Introducing EVEST: EVE Station Trader!**

EVEST monitors the market to let you know when an item in your chosen location is trading at a certain percentage below its usual price. When it finds something, you get a notification. When you feel like it, you log in, take a peek at the item, and maybe set up an order for it.

Meanwhile, EVEST is toiling away in the background, like your very own nullsec miner, trapped in a mixture of Stockholm syndrome and not knowing any better. When one of your items is selling at a higher-than-average price, you get another notification: Time to sell!

It's medium-term swing trading, the lazy way.

## Installing & Running EVEST

I have no idea how this program works yet, because we haven't finished building it yet. Chill out.
